# ProIcons Roblox
The official Roblox Studio plugin for ProIcons.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Due to Roblox [API changes](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/creator-action-required-new-asset-delivery-api-endpoints-for-community-tools/3574403), new ProIcons Roblox uploads have been paused. It is no longer possible to get the image ID of an asset when uploaded outside of Roblox Studio. Uploads will resume once Roblox makes this possible again.
>
> There are still 400+ icons available for use on Roblox, but new and updated icons aren't being uploaded.

## Features
- üìê Modern UI based on [Next-Gen Studio UI](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/next-gen-studio-ui-preview-is-here-beta/3075390)
- üñºÔ∏è High-quality, 128px icons

Uses the [ProIcons Roblox API](https://procode-software.github.io/proicons/docs/roblox-usage) to fetch icon image IDs, so you will always have access to the latest icons when they become available.

## Installation
See [below](#building-from-source).

## Building from Source
### Installing the framework
The UI is created with [Forge](https://github.com/ProCode-Software/Forge). The package has not been published yet, so it must be manually installed.

Add this file at `src/Packages/Framework.luau`:
```luau
local module = require('./_Index/Framework/') -- or wherever <framework>/src/Framework/init.luau is

return module
```
### Installing the plugin
Make sure you have [Rojo](https://rojo.space) installed. Then run the following command to install the plugin into Roblox Studio's plugin folder:
```bash
rojo build -p ProIcons.rbxm --watch
```
